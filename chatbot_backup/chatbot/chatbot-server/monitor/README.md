## Prediction Result

### Object Detection with YOLOv8

The prediction result section utilizes the YOLOv8 object detection models to identify and classify objects in the video stream. YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art deep learning framework known for its high accuracy and real-time performance. The system employs two YOLOv8 models, YOLOv8m and YOLOv8n, to enhance the detection capabilities.

### Interpreting the Prediction Result

The prediction result displays the processed video frame with object detection results overlaid. Each detected object is represented by a bounding box and a corresponding class label. The bounding box indicates the location and size of the detected object, while the class label identifies the category or type of the object.

### Bounding Boxes and Class Labels

- Bounding Boxes: The bounding boxes are rectangular regions that enclose the detected objects. They are typically colored and sized based on the confidence level of the detection. A higher confidence level indicates a more accurate detection.
- Class Labels: The class labels are text annotations placed near the bounding boxes, indicating the category or type of the detected object. The labels provide information about what the system has identified in the video stream.

## YOLOv8 Parameter Adjustments

The YOLOv8 parameter adjustments section allows you to fine-tune the object detection performance by modifying various parameters. Here's a detailed explanation of each parameter:

### Confidence Threshold

The confidence threshold determines the minimum confidence score required for an object to be considered as a valid detection. A higher confidence threshold will result in fewer detections but with higher certainty, while a lower threshold will yield more detections but may include some false positives. Adjust this parameter based on your desired balance between precision and recall.

### IOU Threshold

The Intersection over Union (IOU) threshold is used for non-maximum suppression (NMS) during the object detection process. It determines the minimum overlap required between bounding boxes to be considered as separate objects. A higher IOU threshold will result in more aggressive suppression of overlapping detections, while a lower threshold will allow more overlapping detections to be retained.

### Max Detections

The max detections parameter sets the maximum number of objects that can be detected in a single frame. If the number of detections exceeds this value, the system will prioritize the objects with the highest confidence scores. Adjust this parameter based on the expected number of objects in your 3D printing setup.

### Min Layer Size

The min layer size parameter defines the minimum size of a detected object's bounding box. Objects with bounding boxes smaller than this size will be filtered out. This parameter helps to eliminate small, insignificant detections and focuses on objects of interest. Set this value based on the size of the objects you want to detect.

### Score Threshold for Class Probabilities

The score threshold for class probabilities determines the minimum score required for an object to be assigned a specific class label. A higher threshold will result in more confident class assignments, while a lower threshold will allow more objects to be classified but with potentially lower accuracy. Adjust this parameter based on your desired trade-off between class assignment confidence and coverage.

### NMS Threshold

The Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) threshold is used to remove redundant detections that belong to the same object. It determines the maximum overlap allowed between bounding boxes before suppressing the one with a lower confidence score. A higher NMS threshold will result in more aggressive suppression, while a lower threshold will allow more overlapping detections to be kept.

### Input Image Size

The input image size parameter specifies the dimensions of the input image that will be fed into the YOLOv8 models for object detection. A larger input size will provide more detailed information but may increase processing time, while a smaller size will be faster but may miss smaller objects. Choose an appropriate input size based on your hardware capabilities and the level of detail required for your 3D printing monitoring.

### Applying Parameter Adjustments

To apply the parameter adjustments, modify the values using the provided sliders or input fields in the YOLOv8 parameter adjustments section. Once you have set the desired values, click the "Apply Parameters" button to update the object detection process with the new settings. The system will dynamically adapt to the updated parameters and provide refined detection results.

## Alert Settings

### Configuring Alert Notifications

The alert settings section allows you to configure notifications for specific events during the 3D printing process. By providing your contact information, you can receive alerts via email and SMS when certain conditions are met. This feature helps you stay informed about critical events and take timely actions if needed.
